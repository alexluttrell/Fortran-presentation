		<h1>This is a brief history of FORTRAN programming language</h1>
			
			<p>FORTRAN is a programming language invented by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering purposes. FORTRAN has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry.<p>

			<p>Fortran programs were most often entered on a keypunch keyboard onto 80-column punched cards, one line to a card. The resulting deck of cards would be fed into a card reader to be compiled. Punched-card codes included no lower-case letters or many special characters.<p>

		<h3>Is FORTRAN Intrepreted or Compiled?</h3>

			<p>According to Wikipedia's "List of programming languages by type", FORTRAN is the first high-level, compiled language which is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters 
			(step-by-step executors of source code, where no pre-runtime translation takes place).</p>

		<h3>Is FORTRAN a strongly or weakly typed language?</h3>
 
			<p>According to computer-programming-forum.com, FORTRAN has "always been strongly typed" stating: "In conventional FORTRAN (pre F90), the compiler could determine the types of all objects *within* a given program unit at compile-time because *all* objects within a FORTRAN program unit were locally declared (either implicitly or explicitly). This completely satisfies the usual definition of "strongly typed" since that states: "a language is strongly typed if (and only if) the types of all objects can be determined at compile-time." </p>

		<h3>Imperative, Functional or Logical Language?</h3>
		
			<p>The earliest imperative languages were the machine languages of the original computers. 
			In these languages, instructions were very simple, which made hardware implementation easier, but hindered the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN, developed by John Backus at International Business Machines (IBM) starting in 1954, was the first major programming language to remove the obstacles presented by machine code in the creation of complex programs. FORTRAN was a compiled language that allowed named variables, complex expressions, subprograms, and many other features now common in imperative languages.</p>
